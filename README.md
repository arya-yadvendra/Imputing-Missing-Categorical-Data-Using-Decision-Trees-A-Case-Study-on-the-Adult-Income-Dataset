# Imputing Missing Categorical Data Using Decision Trees: A Case Study on the Adult Income Dataset

Abstract:
Missing data is a common challenge in datasets, often requiring imputation for analysis. This study explores the use of decision tree classifiers for imputing missing categorical values in the Adult Income Dataset. The dataset contains information on individuals' demographic and employment characteristics, with missing values denoted by '?' in categorical columns. We propose a method where decision tree classifiers are trained on non-missing data to predict missing values. The imputed values are then used to complete the dataset for further analysis. Our results show that this approach effectively imputes missing values, improving the dataset's completeness without introducing significant bias.

Introduction:
Missing data can hinder the analysis of datasets, leading to biased results and reduced statistical power. Imputation methods are used to fill in missing values, enabling the use of complete datasets for analysis. Decision tree classifiers have been successfully used for imputing missing values in numerical data. However, their application to categorical data imputation is less explored. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the effectiveness of decision tree classifiers for imputing missing categorical values in the Adult Income Dataset.

Methodology:
We first preprocess the dataset by converting categorical columns to a suitable format for decision tree classification. We then split the dataset into two subsets: one with non-missing values and another with missing values. For each categorical column with missing values, we train a decision tree classifier on the non-missing subset to predict the missing values in the corresponding column of the missing subset. We repeat this process for all categorical columns with missing values, resulting in a dataset with imputed values.

Results:
Our analysis shows that decision tree classifiers can effectively impute missing categorical values in the Adult Income Dataset. The imputed values align well with the distribution of non-missing values, indicating that the imputation process preserves the dataset's characteristics. Furthermore, the imputed dataset can be used for downstream analysis without introducing significant bias.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, decision tree classifiers offer a promising approach for imputing missing categorical values in datasets. The approach presented in this study demonstrates the feasibility of using decision trees for imputation, especially in datasets with a mix of categorical and numerical features. Further research could explore the application of other machine learning models and techniques for handling missing data in different types of datasets.
